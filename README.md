I am a Full Stack Developer extremely passionate and motivated about software technology.
<br>
I have experience designing and implementing scalable solutions, focusing on REST APIs and microservice architecture. I specialize in using technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, and CI/CD pipelines, working within Agile methodologies.
Additionally, I have contributed to projects involving Node.js, Express, Python, and Groovy.
On the Frontend, I have developed interactive and responsive websites using JavaScript and TypeScript, along with React, Redux, HTML, CSS, and Sass.
