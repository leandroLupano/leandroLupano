<h1 align="center">Hi, this is Leandro! 👋</h1>

<p align="left">
I am a fullstack developer extremely passionate and motivated about software technology.
<br>
Additionally, I have a degree in mechanical engineering where I have been working for more than 10 years around different areas allowing me to develop analytical thinking and problem-solving skills among others, that helps me today as a programmer.
<br>
My first exposure to programming was through my work with robots in the automotive industry, which piqued my interest in pursuing this path.
