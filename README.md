<h1 align="center">Hi, this is Leandro! 👋</h1>

<p align="left">
I am a fullstack developer who has recently started in this field, but I am extremely passionate and motivated about software technology.
<br>
Also, I have a degree in mechanical engineering where I have been working for more than 10 years around different areas.
<br>
My first contact with programming was in the automotive industry with robots, which led me to pursue this new path after a couple of years.
<br>
Welcome to my GitHub, where you can find some of my repositories.
